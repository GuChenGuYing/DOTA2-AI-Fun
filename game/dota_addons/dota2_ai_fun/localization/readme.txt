Please use UCS2-LE BOM encoding for your localization file.

Please put hero name and hype in hero_names.txt

Put your localization file in english directory, then add them in filelist.txt

Then use localization_generation.bat to generate addon_language.txt in resource directory

How to add your own language:
create folder along with the folder "english", put respective localization files into this folder. Edit localization_generation.bat: copy all lines, replace "english" with your language.
